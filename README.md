  <ul>
    <li>Since this website showcases a lot of high quality images I mainly focused on making it performance friendly without losing too much quality in the process</li>
    <li>I also decided to use Router for navigation, since there is only two pages there was no reason to use React Router given that Wouter is very lightweight</li>
